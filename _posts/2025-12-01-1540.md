getting a bit tired of waiting in line to cross the bridge every day. Got me thinking if there's an empirical way to reduce traffic on international bridges, based on the day of the week, month, holidays, even the hour, and the number of people who commute at certain designated times. If possible, I could potentially predict the best times ( which is when the traffic on bridges, either by car or on foot, is low) and then go at that time, i don't know how much complicated this might be tho
