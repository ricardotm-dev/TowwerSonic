So I kept investigating, turns out CBP owns a website where you can "check" the logistics in every bridge around the U.S. As one might expect, Mexican borders are outdated, so I can't really use them on a daily basis. However, I could clean the data and use it on a custom dataset I create myself, as well as start timing my waiting intervals over a month. For now, I guess I need to start gathering all the specs and data and maybe even work on a linear regression model
